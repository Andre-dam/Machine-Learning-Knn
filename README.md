# Machine-Learning-Knn
A k-nearest neighbors algorithm implementation made from scratch using python language.

An implementation of the weightened and unweightened knn, using diferent distance functions(euclidean, VDM, HVDM) to handle continuous and categoric data types.

Nearest neighbor and instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous
and linear input values well, but often do not handle symbolic input attributes appropriately.
The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between
symbolic attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes.
